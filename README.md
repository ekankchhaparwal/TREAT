# TREAT
Travel Expense and Tracker aka TREAT is an easy to use offline app that lets you to add you and your friends expenses and share the expense equally at the end of the trip,
This app right now serves only for tracking the expenses of 3 people under One trip.
At the end of your TREAT user gets a flow chart analysis of all the 3 friends in contribution of their expenses of the trip. User can also use it as a personal expense manager.
For the local storage of data I have used shared Preferences.
